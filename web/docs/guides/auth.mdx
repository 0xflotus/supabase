### User Management

Supabase makes it simple to manage your users.

</video>

When a user signs up, Supabase assigns them a unique ID. You can reference this ID anywhere in your database. For example, you might create a `profiles` table references the user using a `user_id` field.

Supabase provides the routes to [sign up](/docs/client/auth-signup), [login](/docs/client/auth-signin), [log out](/docs/client/auth-signout), and manage users in your apps and websites.


### Third Party Logins

We currently support the following OAuth providers:
- Google
- Github
- Gitlab
- Bitbucket

You can enable providers by navigating to Authentication > Settings > External OAuth Providers and inputting your `Client ID` and `Secret` for each.

To fetch these you need to:

1. Generate `Client ID` and `Secret` ([google](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials), [github](https://github.com/settings/applications/new), [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/oauth/applications), [bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud/))
2. Enter Authorized Redirect URI: `http://<your-project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` on provider dashboard

### Row Level Security

Authentication only gets you so far. When you need granular authorization rules, nothing beats PostgreSQL's [Row Level Security](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html). Supabase makes it simple to turn RLS on and off.

### Policies

[Policies](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpolicy.html) are PostgreSQL's rule engine. They are incredibly powerful and flexible, allowing you to write complex SQL rules which fit your unique business needs.

With policies, your database becomes the rules engine. Instead of repetitively filtering your queries, like this ...

```js
const loggedInUserId = 'd0714948'
let { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('users')
    .select('user_id, name')
    .eq('user_id', loggedInUserId)

// console.log(data)
// => { id: 'd0714948', name: 'Jane' }
```

... you can simply define a rule on your database table, `auth.uid() = user_id`, and your request will return the rows which pass the rule, even when you remove the filter from your middleware:

```js
let user = await supabase
    .from('users')
    .select('user_id, name')

// console.log(data)
// Still => { id: 'd0714948', name: 'Jane' }
```
