### Introduction

Supabase makes it easy to manage your users.

When a user signs up, Supabase assigns them a unique ID. You can reference this ID anywhere in your database. For example, you might create a `profiles` table references the user using a `user_id` field.

Supabase provides the routes to sign up, login, log out, and manage users in your apps and websites.

### `signUp()`

<CustomCodeBlock header="New user." js={signUp} />
<br />

Allow your users to sign up and create a new account.

After they have signed up, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be performed as "that user".

### `signIn()`

<CustomCodeBlock header="Existing user." js={signIn} />
<br />

If an account is created, users can login to your app.

After they have logged in, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be performed as "that user".

### `signOut()`

<CustomCodeBlock header="Clear the user's session." js={signOut} />
<br />

After calling log out, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be "anonymous".

### `user()`

<CustomCodeBlock header="Get the logged in user." js={userData} />
<br />

### `update()`

<CustomCodeBlock header="Update the user data." js={update} />
<br />

Updates the user data if there is a logged in user. This should only be used for storing static data for the user. 
For more advanced cases, you should instead create a `users` table in your `public` schema, which references the user in `auth.users` via the user ID.


### `onAuthStateChange()`

We provide a convenient wrapper for listening to auth changes. Statuses are either `'SIGNED_IN'`, `'SIGNED_OUT'`, or `'USER_UPDATED'`.

<CustomCodeBlock header="Sign in with a third party provider." js={onAuthStateChange} />

### Third Party Logins

We currently support the following OAuth providers:
- Google
- Github
- Gitlab
- Bitbucket

You can enable providers by navigating to Authentication > Settings > External OAuth Providers and inputting your `Client ID` and `Secret` for each.

To fetch these you need to:

1. Generate `Client ID` and `Secret` ([google](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials), [github](https://github.com/settings/applications/new), [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/oauth/applications), [bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud/))
2. Enter Authorized Redirect URI: `http://<your-project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` on provider dashboard

Once these steps are completed, you can use the `signIn()` method with the enabled provider:

<CustomCodeBlock header="Sign in with a third party provider." js={signInOauth} />
