Subscribe to realtime changes in your own database.

### Listen to all database changes

<CustomCodeBlock
  header="Subscribes to all database changes in realtime."
  js={subscribeAllJs}
/>

<br />

If you want to receive the "previous" data for updates and deletes,
you will need to set `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL`, like this:
`ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`

### Listening to a specific table

<CustomCodeBlock
  header="Subscribes to a specific table for changes in realtime."
  js={subscribeTableJs}
/>

<br />

If you want to receive the "previous" data for updates and deletes,
you will need to set `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL`, like this:
`ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`

### Listening only to INSERT

<CustomCodeBlock
  header="Subscribes only to the INSERT event."
  js={subscribeInsertsJs}
/>

### Listening only to UPDATE

<CustomCodeBlock
  header="Subscribes only to the UPDATE event."
  js={subscribeUpdatesJs}
/>

<br />

If you want to receive the "previous" data for updates,
you will need to set `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL`, like this:
`ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`

### Listening only to DELETE

<CustomCodeBlock
  header="Subscribes only to the DELETE event."
  js={subscribeDeletesJs}
/>

<br />

You will not be able to delete data from your database unless you set your set your table to use FULL `REPLICA IDENTITY`, like this:
`ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`

### Listening to multiple events


<CustomCodeBlock
  header="Subscribes to multiple but not all events."
  js={subscribeMultipleJs}
/>

<br />

You can chain listeners if you want to listen to multiple events for each table.

### Listening to row changes


<CustomCodeBlock
  header="Listen to individual rows."
  js={subscribeRowJs}
/>

<br />

You can listen to individual rows using the format `{table}:{col}.eq.{val}` - where `{col}` is the column name, and `{val}` is the value which you want to match.

### Unsubscribing

<CustomCodeBlock
  header="Unsubscribes from a specific subscription."
  js={subscribeUnsubscribeJs}
/>

### Removing a subscription

<CustomCodeBlock
  header="Disconnects from a subscription fully."
  js={subscribeRemoveJs}
/>

## Reference

### `from()`

<FromFunction verb="subscribe" />

### `on()`

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
const mySubscription = supabase
  .from('tableName')
  .on('eventType', callbackFunction)
```

#### `eventType: string { "INSERT" | "UPDATE" | "DELETE" | "*" }`

The database event which you would like to receive updates for, or you can use the special wildcard `*` to listen to all changes.

#### `callbackFunction: function`

A callback that will handle the payload that is sent whenever your database changes. See all Change Events below to understand all the possible payloads.

---

### `subscribe()`

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
const mySubscription = supabase
  .from(tableName)
  .on(eventType, callbackFunction)
  .subscribe()
```

Subscribes to the database table specified in `from()` and starts listening to it. An object of type _subscription_ will be returned.

```js
mySubscription.subscribe()
```

If the subscription already exists, but has been unsubscribed from with the function `unsubscribe()`, it can be subscribed to again through the above method.

---

### `unsubscribe()`

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
mySubscription
  .unsubscribe()
```

Stop listening to changes. At any point you can call `subscribe` on the subscription object to restart the listeners.
If you don't need to connect again in the future, use `removeSubscription()` instead.

---

### `removeSubscription()`

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
supabase
  .removeSubscription(mySubscription)
```

Disconnects and destroys a subscription. This is the preferred method for cleaning up subscriptions which you no longer require.

#### `mySubscription: subscription`

A subscription that was previously created. If you don't have access to the subscription, you can always call `getSubscriptions()`.

---

### `getSubscriptions()`

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
supabase
  .getSubscriptions()
```

Returns an array of all your subscriptions.
