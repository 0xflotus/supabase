### Introduction

Supabase makes it easy to manage your users.

When a user signs up, Supabase assigns them a unique ID. You can reference this ID anywhere in your database. For example, you might create a `profiles` table references the user using a `user_id` field.

Supabase provides the routes to sign up, login, log out, and manage users in your apps and websites.


### Sign up


<CustomCodeBlock
  header="New user."
  js={signup}
/>
<br />

Allow your users to sign up and create a new account.

After they have signed up, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be performed as "that user".

By default, signups auto-confirm, if you require users to confirm their email address toggle this on in Auth > Settings via the Supabase dashboard.

### Log in

<CustomCodeBlock
  header="Existing user."
  js={login}
/>
<br />

If an account is created, users can login to your app.

After they have logged in, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be performed as "that user".

### User data

<CustomCodeBlock
  header="Get the logged in user."
  js={userData}
/>
<br />

Get the JSON data for the logged in user.

### Log out

<CustomCodeBlock
  header="Clear the user's session."
  js={logout}
/>
<br />

After calling log out, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be "anonymous".

### Password Reset

This functionality is not yet inside supabase-js but is available on your Supabase API as HTTP endpoints:

Request a recovery url to be sent to a user:

<CustomCodeBlock
  header="Request recovery email."
  js={requestRecoveryTokenEmail}
/>
<br />

The link inside the email will take the form `<your-app-url>?recovery_token=<SOME-TOKEN>` where `your-app-url` is the url provided on the Supabase dashboard at Project > Auth > Settings

Your app should take the `recovery_token` and make a request to the verify endpoint which will return an accessToken good for 60 mins (effectively logging the user in to your app):

<CustomCodeBlock
  header="Use recovery token to get access token."
  js={verifyRecoveryToken}
/>
<br />

Next you need to provide your user with a new password form, which should send the new password to the `/auth/v1/user` endpoint as a PUT

<CustomCodeBlock
  header="Update user's password."
  js={updateUser}
/>
<br />

### Email Confirmation

Email confirmations can be enabled via the dashboard. Navigate to Auth > Settings within your project and uncheck "Disable Email Confirmations".

Then head to Auth > Templates to customize the email.

You can also add your own SMTP credentials on the settings page if you'd prefer to use your own email server.
